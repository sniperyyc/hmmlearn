Sampling from HMM
-----------------

This script shows how to sample points from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM):
we use a 4-state model with specified mean and covariance.

The plot show the sequence of observations generated with the transitions
between them. We can see that, as specified by our transition matrix,
there are no transition between component 1 and 3.
